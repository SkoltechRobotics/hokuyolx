This module aims to implement communication protocol with Hokuyo
laser rangefinder scaners, specifically with the following models:
UST-10LX, UST-20LX, UST-30LX.
It was tested only with UST-10LX but should work with others as well.
It's Python 2 and 3 compatible but was mainly tested using Python 3.
